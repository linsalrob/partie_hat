# partie_hat

partie_hat is the "High throughput automated typing for the partition engine", the "partition engine using humanly assessed tags", or the "highly accurate tags for the partition engine".

We have manually curated the environments and hosts of a whole lot of microbial genomes, and are using those to assess metagenomes from [partie](https://github.com/linsalrob/partie).
